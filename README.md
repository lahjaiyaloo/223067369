Lab 5 - WAD621S Styling Lab
Overview

In this lab, I created a modern, responsive UI using CSS. The HTML structure was provided, but all styling was implemented independently. I focused on cards, buttons, forms, navigation, a calendar, and a mood tracker. The lab includes interactive hover states, responsive layouts, and light/dark theme support.

Features

Cards: Shadow effects, rounded corners, hover lift/scale, smaller images for readability

Buttons: Primary, success, warning, info, outline variants; hover, disabled, and transform effects

Forms: Styled labels, inputs, selects, and textareas; focus states for accessibility

Navigation: Horizontal bar with active and hover states

Mood Tracker & Calendar: Interactive emoji and date selection with visual feedback

Themes: Light and dark mode using CSS variables

Responsive Design: Component grid adjusts for tablets and mobile devices

Challenges

Card Images: Adjusting image size without breaking layout

Button Hover Effects: Balancing subtle scaling and shadow for a clean look

Responsive Grid: Ensuring all components remain readable and aligned on smaller screens

Mood Tracker & Calendar: Implementing hover and active states consistently across devices
